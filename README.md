Latex Templates for ICI3D presentations. Pre-2022-reboot

## To borrow

* Clone or download the repo as a subdirectory (or submodule) of your working directory. 

* Copy `example.tex` to your working directory (probably changing the name).

* Fill in metadata where the file says "Fill in"

* Replace the content

You can see [a rendered version of the example file](https://github.com/ICI3D/LatexTemplates/blob/master/git_push/example.pdf).

## JD themes

ICI3D events and info are updated at ici3dCurrent.tex in this (LatexTemplates) directory. NTU is also here, and other workshops could be as well.

Format rules that switch content: look for *.set in talk Makefile (should point to *.txt.format here in templates)

beamer.tmp has things to be commented in and out (this should probably be fixed)
